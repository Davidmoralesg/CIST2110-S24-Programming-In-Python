    "# Boolean expressions are statements that can be either True or False\n",
    "# As a reminder a boolean statement is a statement that is either True or False, 1 or 0, yes or no\n",
    "# You can use Conditional Statments to evaluate boolean expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean Expressions are created using relational operators\n",
    "# Relational Operators are used to compare two values\n",
    "# The relational operators are:\n",
    "# == - Equal to\n",

    "# <= - Less than or equal to\n",

    "# Note when watching lecture back the \"Font Ligatures\" are on and the \"!=\" looks like a single character\n",
